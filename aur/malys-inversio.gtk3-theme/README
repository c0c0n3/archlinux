TODO: * Bahamas -> package is available in AUR, so list as a dep in PKGBUILD
      * Theme not displaying properly (as in picture) as of Oct 2013; tried
        to use original theme, but had same issue.

Malys Inversio GTK3 Theme
=========================

This directory contains the stuff needed to create a 'malys-inversio' Arch 
package to install my modified version of the Malys Inversio White theme---
see 
 * http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/malys+-+inversio++?content=152965


Modifications
-------------
I took out the bahamas font and gtk-3.0 dirs of the theme and ditched all the
rest.  Also within the gtk-3.0 dir I removed most of the css files as they
weren't needed without GNOME and modified the inlcudes in gtk.css accordingly.
Finally I fixed up a whole bunch of errors in gtk-widgets.css---not using px,
space after url, etc; these would result in annoying warnings on stdout when
launching a GTK app.


Instructions
------------
1. make                              (will create the pkg in bin dir)
2. cd bin
3. pacman -U malys-<...>.xz          (install the package)
4. cd .. && make clean               (optionally, remove bin dir)
5. Put the following in ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini

[Settings]
gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme = false
gtk-theme-name = malys-inversio
gtk-fallback-icon-theme = gnome
gtk-icon-theme-name = buuficontheme
gtk-font-name = Bahamas 12

(NB you should have installed the Buuf Icon Theme from AUR.)
