ftypes - font types
--------------------

Many font families are released in more than one format (TrueType, OpenType and
Type 1 being the most popular). In this folder you should place basic fontconfig
rules for the _exact_ version you are using and symlink them from
/etc/fonts/conf.d, e.g.

  # ln -s ../conf.avail.infinality/ftypes/90-tt-foo.conf .
