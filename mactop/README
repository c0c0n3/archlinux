This is a snapshot (07 AUG 2012) of Arch Linux as it was installed on my MacBook Pro --- 
17-inch, Mid 2010; Model Identifier: MacBookPro6,1.  
(See: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4132)

NB I only have included what is needed to recreate a working system without my data.
(i.e. I only included config files, AUR-built packages, and instructions; btw,
I copied the whole /etc over as it was.)

The _root_ directory represents the root (/) of the Arch system and the all the files
below it have been kept in the same hierarchical position as they were on the original
Arch system.
