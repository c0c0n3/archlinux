# Run the automount script if there's activity (add,change,remove) on any of
# the media partitions we're interested in.
# Note that we never grab the device itself (e.g. sdb), but rather any
# available partitions on it (e.g. sdb1, sdb2). 
# Also note that we exclude sda which is this laptop hard-drive.
