	                SYSTEM INSTALLATION & CONFIGURATION
===========================================================================================


3. DESKTOP SUPPORT
==================

3.1. ALSA (http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ALSA)
---------

 * pacman -S alsa-utils alsa-oss

 * rc.conf -> DAEMONS=(.. @alsa   ..)

 * /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf -> install pcspkr /bin/false

 * Unmute the channels and test: alsamixer
   NB you have to set Front Sp and Surround close to 100 to hear anything.

 * Restore ALSA Mixer settings at startup:
   	   
     alsactl -f /var/lib/alsa/asound.state store

 NOTES
 -----
 1. Blacklisting of snd-pcm-oss.  This driver interfers with Pulse Audio:

    + https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PulseAudio#ALSA

 so you need to blacklist it if you install GNOME which pulls down Pulse Audio as a
 dependency.  Just add the following line to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf:

   install snd_pcm_oss /bin/false

 For more info on blacklisting, see:
   * https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Blacklisting
   * http://www.archlinux.org/news/changes-to-module-blacklisting/


3.2. Xorg (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xorg)
---------
 
 * pacman -S xorg xf86-input-evdev xf86-input-synaptics
 
 * For config see /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/*
 
   NOTE
   ----
   1. xorg includes xorg-server which depends on xf86-input-evdev, so technically it could
   be omitted from the above cmd line.

   2. TODO: DPMS (LCD power saving).
   I initially configured it as specified in https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/DPMS,
   specifying the following options: StandbyTime, SuspendTime, OffTime.
   However, the NVIDIA driver complained (/var/log/Xorg.log.0) that the options are 
   "Unused"; so I moved them under ServerFlags --- which is where they belong according
   to the Xorg manual.  Now, although NVIDIA doesn't complain anymore, it seems those
   setting have no effect as 'xset -q' shows

      DPMS (Energy Star):
       Standby: 0    Suspend: 0    Off: 0   <-- i.e. specified values are ignored
       DPMS is Enabled
       Monitor is On

   For the record, I also tried out the options detailed at
      http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/power-management-guide.xml
   which had no effect either, except for the "blank time" option which causes NVIDIA to
   output an error ("WAIT...") in /var/log/Xorg.log.0.  


3.3. NVIDIA (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NVIDIA, 
-----------  http://tutanhamon.com.ua/technovodstvo/NVIDIA-UNIX-driver/)

 * pacman -S nvidia nvidia-utils
 
 * For config see /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-nvidia.conf and 00-layout.conf

  NOTES
  -----
  1. Power-saving configured as follows:

    PowerMizerEnable=0x1; PerfLevelSrc=0x2233; PowerMizerDefault=0x3

  i.e. max power saving on battery, adaptive strategy on AC.

  2. NVIDIA switches b/w battery and AC by communication w/ acpid --- installed earlier.

  3. TODO: hotkey events.
  The driver complains about not being able to find brightness and DOS files under 
  /proc/acpi/video --- see /var/log/Xorg.log.0; this means the driver will not respond
  to hotkeys events to adjust backlight brightness and display changes.
  (NB I've checked which ACPI modules are available as described on the wiki:
   http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ACPI_modules; lsmod tells video is loaded!
  However, note that mbp-nvidia-bl uses a different directory.)


3.4. Touchpad (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Touchpad_Synaptics,
-------------  https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xorg)
 
  * pacman -S xf86-input-synaptics

  * For config see /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-synaptics.conf and 10-evdev.conf
 
  * To disable tap & scroll while typing add the following to .xinitrc before launching
    the VM (requires SHMConfig enabled in 10-synaptics.conf)

      syndaemon -t -k -i 2 -d &
     
    If using GNOME, the above should be added instead to the Startup Applications
    (System -> Preferences)

    NOTE
    ----
    Enabling the following options causes the touchpad to become irresponsive: 
    "VertEdgeScroll" and "HorizEdgeScroll"


3.5. Keyboard Hotkeys
---------------------
GNOME recognises all the keys I care about (LCD/keyboard backlight, volume, eject) except
for the keyboard backlight.  All those keys can easily be set up in Xmonad too, so there's
no need to use any of the following:

  * ACPI hotkeys (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ACPI_hotkeys)
    This would have been easy, but acpi_listen doesn't detect any of the above keys.

  * Xbindkeys (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xbindkeys)  
    This seems fairly easy too, but depends on Xorg so I won't work from a console (I'd
    guess).  Also when I tried to catch key bindings under GNOME (xbindkeys -k), nothing
    would be detected because GNOME was already consuming that event --- again I suppose;
    in fact, after killing gnome-power-manager, the key binding would show up.

  * Keytouch (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Keytouch)
    I haven't actually tried this, but it seems rather complex.
 
  * pommed
    Although recommended in the MacBook install guide, it seems to cause the laptop to
    overheat: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=97233

3.6. Fonts (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Font_Configuration,
----------  http://www.infinality.net/blog/?p=67)
 
 * pacman -S ttf-bitstream-vera ttf-dejavu ttf-ms-fonts
   pacman -S monaco-linux-font ttf-gentium ttf-isabella

 * Copy Infinity /etc/fonts/local.conf

 * Disable ~/.fonts.conf:
   + remove everything inside <fontconfig>[REMOVE ME]</fontconfig> tags
   + sudo chattr +i /home/YOUR-USERNAME/.fonts.conf
     (this way GNOME won't be able to write to the file, which would override our settings
      in /etc/fonts/local.conf)
 
 * Make sure cairo and libxft are installed: pacman -Q | egrep '^(cairo |libxft )'

 * Put the following in ~/.Xresources:
       Xft.autohint: 0
       Xft.lcdfilter:  lcddefault
       Xft.hintstyle:  hintfull
       Xft.hinting: 1
       Xft.antialias: 1
       Xft.dpi: 96
       Xft.rgba: rgb
