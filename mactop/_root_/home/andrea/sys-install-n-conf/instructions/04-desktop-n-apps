	                SYSTEM INSTALLATION & CONFIGURATION
===========================================================================================


4. APPLICATIONS (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Lightweight_Applications,
===============  https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Common_Applications)

We're only installing lightweight GTK apps which do not depend on Qt and KDE libs.
Ideally, we should avoid dependencies on GNOME too; the following apps (listed in the
instructions below) have some dependencies on GNOME:

 * evince
 * gnome-terminal
 * gucharmap


4.1. Haskell
------------
 * pacman -S haskell-platform 
 * pacman -S darcs
 * pacman -S emacs-haskell-mode

4.2. Latex (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/LaTeX,
----------  https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/TeX_Live_FAQ)
 * pacman -S texlive-most
 * pacman -S auctex

4.3. Internet
-------------
 * pacman -S chromium
 * pacman -S aria2

  NOTES
  -----
  1. Aria2 is a lightweight, command-line download manager featuring support for 
  HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, BitTorrent and Metalink protocols.
  See:
    + https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Aria2

  It can also be used to speed up pacman, see:

    + https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Improve_Pacman_Performance

  2. Flash Plugin.  Currently flashplugin only works on 32-bit architectures, so
  I have not installed to avoid bringing in all the 32-bit compatibility libs.

  3. Google Reader.  Install Chromium plugin --- extensions > RSS Subscription or
  browse to its home page.

4.4. Viewers
------------
 * pacman -S evince
 * pacman -S feh

  NOTES
  -----
  1. feh (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Feh)  
  Command-line image viewer; can also set a background image if the WM doesn't support it.
 
  2. CHM viewer.  If you ever need to view CHM files, do not install kchmviewer as it
  requires Qt and lots of KDE libs.

4.5. Graphics
-------------
Do not install gimp and inkscape as they bring in some GNOME deps as well as Python.
Consider using Image Magick.

4.6. Other
----------
 * pacman -S gnome-terminal
 * pacman -S aspell aspell-en
 * pacman -S gucharmap



5. DESKTOP ENVIRONMENT
======================

5.1. Display Manager (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Display_Manager)
--------------------
Qingy (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Qingy,
       http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Qingy)
It uses the framebuffer and so does not require to start X.  For this reason we prefer it
over GDM.  (Also it has no GNOME dependencies.)

 * pacman -S qingy

 * edit /etc/inittab
    + boot to console (i.e. use line 'id:3:initdefault:')
  
    + change tty manager for tty1; replace
      	     c1:2345:respawn:/sbin/agetty -8 38400 tty1 linux
      with:
             c1:2345:respawn:/sbin/qingy tty1
* Qingy/GDM integration:
   + cp /etc/X11/sessions/xmonad.desktop /etc/X11/sessions/my.xmonad.desktop
   + edit /etc/X11/sessions/my.xmonad.desktop:
     - Name=My XMonad
     - Exec=/usr/local/bin/start-xmonad
    + comment out all lines for starting a login manager ('x:5:...')

 * edit /etc/qingy/settings to add/change following:
       log_facilities = console, file
       screensaver "photos" = "/usr/share/qingy/themes/cape-lambda/screensaver"
       theme = "cape-lambda"

 * edit /etc/directfbrc to add line:
      disable-module=linux_input

 * edit /boot/grub/menu.lst to set kernel boot param: vga=795

 * make cape-lambda Qingy theme
    + cd to look-n-feel/qingy-themes/cape-lambda
    + ./make-theme
    + extract cape-lambda.tgz in /usr/share/qingy/themes/

  NOTES
  -----
  1. Framebuffer.  It works with VESA, hence the use of the vga kernel parameter; this
  avoids the hassle of installing and configuring e.g. uvesafb.  Going forward, consider
  using KMS: still doesn't support nVidia at this stage, but support will be added in
  the future.  See:
      * https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernel_Mode_Setting
      * http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/KMS
      * https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Intel

  2. Framebuffer resolutions.  Run (as root) 'hwinfo --framebuffer' to see which ones are
  supported.


5.2. Lightweight Desktop
------------------------

5.2.1. Xmonad (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xmonad)
-------------
 * pacman -S xmonad xmonad-contrib
 * mkdir ~/.xmonad and copy xmonad.hs over

 * hotkeys; see:
   + https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Extra_Keyboard_Keys
   + Documentation of XMonad.Util.EZConfig module
 
 * start up script:
   + cp /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc /usr/local/bin/start-xmonad
   + chmod +x /usr/local/bin/start-xmonad
   + edit /usr/local/bin/start-xmonad:
     - remove the lines (towards end of file) that launch programs --- twn, xterm, etc.
     - add the following at end of file:
   
     syndaemon -t -k -i 2 -d &
     exec xmonad 

 * GDM/Qingy integration:
   + cp /etc/X11/sessions/xmonad.desktop /etc/X11/sessions/my.xmonad.desktop
   + edit /etc/X11/sessions/my.xmonad.desktop:
     - Name=My XMonad
     - Exec=/usr/local/bin/start-xmonad

  NOTES
  -----
  1. Start up script.  It can be used to launch XMonad from any login manager or directly
  from a console.  (In the latter case, you need to have a ~/.xinitrc to call the script;
  then running startx from the console will start XMonad.)
  The script allows to easly do some set up work before launching XMonad, most notably
  launching some start up applications like syndaemon.  (Doing that in the XMonad config
  file is hairy because every Mod+q would cause the script to be re-executed and so we'd
  have to kill all start up apps before launching them again.) 

  2. Misbehaving Touchpad.  The touchpad needs a 3-finger tap for the right-click.  (It
  does work fine under GNOME though.)  I'm not going to fix this for now also because it
  has nice side-effects: two-finger scrolling works in most apps and 2-finger tap in 
  Chromium over a link opens it in a new tab;

  3. Misbehaving Chromium.  Make sure to select the "Hide system title bar ..." option 
  under Preferences->Personal Stuff->Appearence.  Otherwise Chromium will grab all
  available screen space and will not respond to Super+C, Super+Shift+n, etc.
 
  4. Fonts look smaller.  The same app (e.g. GNOME terminal, emacs) shows fonts smaller
  than they look in GNOME --- NB the font size is the same, e.g. Monaco 11pt for emacs.
  The screen resolution seems to be the same both in GNOME and XMonad, so maybe it's
  got to do with the DPI?  In any case, the smaller look perhaps makes it for better 
  use of screen real estate in XMonad.

5.2.2. Applets
--------------
 * pacman -S conky
 * cp look-n-feel/conky/conkyrc.xmonad ~/.conkyrc
 * add it to start-xmonad --- command: conky

 * pacman -S pcmanfm

  NOTES
  -----
  1. Conky (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Conky)
  We use it as a system dashboard for Xmonad.
  Also look at this guy's nice idea:
    + http://blog.brixandersen.dk/?p=67

  2. PCManFM (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pcmanfm)  
  File manager.  It can show a desktop (--desktop option, see also --desktop-pref option); 
  however, the desktop feature doesn't work nicely with Xmonad.

5.2.3. L&F Tweaks (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GTK+)
-----------------

 * GTK 3 Theme.  
    - Install Buuf icon theme from the AUR;
    - Build & install malys-inversio---see its README for instructions. 
      
    NOTES
    -----
    1. malys-inversio is my modified version of the theme; if it becomes available in
    the AUR, then ditch my own package?
    2. My malys-inversio package brings in gtk-engine-unico as a dep.

 * Cursor and Wallpaper.  Add to start-xmonad:
     xsetroot -cursor_name left_ptr
     feh --bg-scale /home/andrea/sys-install-n-conf/look-n-feel/wallpapers/lambda-radiance-1.jpg

 * Terminal: use Monaco 11 font, hide menubar.

5.2.4. XScreensaver (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xscreensaver)
-------------------
 
 * pacman -S xscreensaver

 * edit /usr/local/bin/start-xmonad to add: /usr/bin/xscreensaver -no-splash &

 * launch xscreensaver-demo.
     + Display Modes: select 'Only One Screensaver' and GLSlideshow.
     + Advanced: check 'Choose Random Image' with dir: look-n-feel/cosmos-screensaver
     + Settings: 
        o Always show at least this much of the image: 100%
        o Time until loading new image: 10 seconds
        o Letterbox: uncheck
   
  NOTES
  -----
  1. You can manually start the screensaver any time with: 

         xscreensaver-command -activate


5.2.5. Other
------------

 * in rc.conf: MODULES=(... fuse ...)
               DEAMONS=(... dbus ...)  # should be one of the first daemons to start

  NOTES
  -----
  Some applications may require D-Bus so we add it to the deamons.  Also, FUSE may come in
  handy.  You may also consider installing Gamin.
