BURG
----
This could potentially replace both rfetit and grub 1.
it's based on grub 2 and has nice graphical themes, however it's still in AUR...

FSTAB
-----
The new kernel supports tmpfs, see https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Fstab#tmpfs.
We already have a physical partition mounted on /tmp, so for now we won't use tmpfs;
however, this could be something to consider in the future...

TEXTLIVE
--------
Build files are broken---e.g. dvt-fp-learning/build.
One problem is documented here:

  * https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/17978
  * http://tug.org/pipermail/tlbuild/2010q1/001307.html

and can be solved by setting 'openout_any = a' globally in /etc/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf.
Is there a better option?
Anyway, there were also other issues when building presentation-1 in dvt-fp-learning
which I didn't have time to investigate.

HOLD OFF until we upgrade to the new version of TexLive and then fix.
